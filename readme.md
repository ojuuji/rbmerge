# How to Build

Script is already prepared for use. See [documentation](docs/readme.md) for details about installation and the usage.

It uses multiple CSV data tables from [Rebrickable Downloads](https://rebrickable.com/downloads/). These tables are embedded in the script. Origin file `rbmerge.base.js` contains placeholders for the tables data, and `build.sh` script is responsible for downloading and embedding necessary data. So, resulting script `rbmerge.js` is generated by `build.sh` and never edited manually.

To download and embed the latest version of necessary tables use `build.sh all`. It fetches the latest tables and replaces them in `/data` directory (can be done alone using `build.sh fetch`), ensures the tables still have expected structure (can be done alone using `build.sh verify`), and builds `rbmerge.js` script (can be done alone using `build.sh build`).
