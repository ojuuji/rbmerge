One of many great features, provided by Rebrickable, is possibility to export all your parts, or even arbitrary inventories, as a single plain table, which then can be used offline. In some cases this may be more convenient or faster than using the site.

However, suppose you are prototyping something and you want to know how many connectors [42195](https://rebrickable.com/parts/42195/) you have. If there are more than one color, multiple rows will be scattered over the table. You may even have an older mold [26287](https://rebrickable.com/parts/26287/).

But you just want to know how many such parts you have, regardless of colors or molds, which you may not even be aware of.

This is where RBmerge may be handy. It merges together all the same parts of different colors, molds, prints, etc.

Here is an example how the part 42195, mentioned above, may look in the table before and after RBmerge:

|Example of part 42195 in original table|Example of part 42195 in merged table|
|---|---|
|[![Example of part 42195 in original table](images/example_part_42195_original.png)](images/example_part_42195_original.png)|[![Example of part 42195 in merged table](images/example_part_42195_merged.png)](images/example_part_42195_merged.png)|

In the merged table all part variants are listed together while still retaining info about variations. For example, you still can check how many colors are there, or how many molds and parts per mold. Detailed description of the table structure can be found in the [Help â†’ Table Structure](help/#table-structure) topic.

RBmerge comes in two flavors: [Web Application](/app/) and [User Script](/script/).
